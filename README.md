# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run the project - 

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Step 2: Go to your react app directory -
	cd guardian
Step 3: Run the following commands in your terminal - 
	npm run dev (to start the project)
Step 4: Click the link that comes up in the terminal , that will redirect to your browser open your app

for database connection -

#

 Install Xampp and MySQL server (Xampp already has MySQl but it seems to doesn't work sometimes , so just installing MySQL seperately is a better option and you don't have to run it explicitly everytime , it's always on as soon as you start your system)

Project Structure -

src: Contains the source code of the React application.
public: Contains static assets and the HTML file.
components: Contains React components used in the project.
